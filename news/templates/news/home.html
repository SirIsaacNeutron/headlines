  It goes without saying, but the author of this website does not necessarily
  endorse the contents of any news articles found while using it.

  Another note: Unfortunately, despite what the results page may say, this website
  will only be able to get 100 results maximum per query. This is because the
  website uses a free NewsAPI key to find articles, and the cheapest non-free
  key is $449 a month.
